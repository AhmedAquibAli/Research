Due to the epithelial and the non-epithelial histology of the affected organ, many histological types of parotid tumors are possible, although some are rare. Salivary gland tumors are characterized by diverse histological appearances and variable biological behavior. The distinction between tumor types can be difficult, particularly based on material from fine-needle aspiration (FNA). There are several other aspects of salivary gland tumors that make them interesting. The commonest benign tumor (pleomorphic adenoma) has a malignant transformation potential, and, although considered benign, there is a propensity for recurrence after treatment. It is not surprising that with such a wealth of pathology, clinical features, investigation issues, and contentious treatment options that salivary gland neoplasms are regularly used in clinical examinations. Malignant salivary gland tumors usually present after the 6th decade of life, whereas benign lesions present in the 4-5th decade of life. Benign lesions tend to be more common in women, but malignant lesions tend to occur with equal frequency in both genders.  The majority of salivary gland tumors occur in the parotid, about 10% occur in the submandibular gland, and less than 4% occur in the minor salivary glands. Most parotid gland tumors are benign, of which the most important is the pleomorphic adenoma. On the other hand, lesions occurring in the submandibular gland and the minor salivary glands are more likely to be malignant. Mortality from salivary gland tumors depends on the stage.

We hypothesize that abdominal ultrasonography is superior to the clinical impression of the surgeon in detecting the cause of peritonitis.\nDESIGN: A prospective case series.\nSETTING: A major university hospital in Taiwan, Republic of China.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred two patients with a diagnosis of peritonitis admitted to the Department of Emergency Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, were included in this study. All 102 patients underwent an abdominal ultrasonographic examination; and the ultrasonographic findings of these patients were classified into 2 categories: positive findings and normal screening results. The accuracy of clinical impression in detecting the cause of peritonitis was compared with the accuracy of abdominal ultrasonography.\nRESULTS: Ultrasonography and clinical impression accurately diagnosed the peritonitis in 85 (83.3%) and 52 (51.0%) of the patients, respectively. The difference between ultrasonography and clinical impression in the diagnosis of peritonitis was significant (P<.001). Among 45 patients without a preoperative clinical diagnosis, a diagnosis was made by ultrasonography for 32 (71%) of them. There were a total of 98 patients with positive ultrasonographic findings, and 4 patients had normal screening results. Of the 98 patients with positive ultrasonographic findings undergoing surgery, all had abdominal pathological characteristics. The 4 patients with normal screening results received nonoperative treatment.\nCONCLUSIONS: Ultrasonography is a more sensitive technique than clinical judgment in diagnosing peritonitis. Ultrasonography may be a useful diagnosing modality in patients with peritonitis in whom the clinical cause is unclear.","author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"S. C."},{"family":"Lin","given":"F.

The study involved 38 elderly patients with (a) severe knee OA pain lasting more than 3 months, (b) positive response to a diagnostic genicular nerve block and (c) no response to conservative treatments. Patients were randomly assigned to receive percutaneous RF genicular neurotomy under ﬂuoroscopic guidance (RF group; n = 19) or the same procedure without effective neurotomy (control group; n = 19). Visual analogue scale (VAS), Oxford knee scores, and global perceived effect on a 7-point scale were measured at baseline and at 1, 4, and 12 weeks post-procedure. VAS scores showed that the RF group had less knee joint pain at 4 (p < 0.001) and 12 (p < 0.001) weeks compared with the control group. Oxford knee scores showed similar ﬁndings (p < 0.001).

Cadaveric studies demonstrate significant variability in the location of the genicular nerves, which has stimulated debate about the ideal target locations for genicular RFA. Despite this, favorable outcomes have been observed in studies targeting only the superior medial genicular nerve, inferior medial genicular nerve, and superior lateral genicular nerve. Several randomized controlled trials demonstrate superiority of genicular RFA compared with intra-articular steroid, viscosupplementation, and oral analgesics. Genicular RFA of the superior medial genicular nerve, inferior medial genicular nerve, and superior lateral genicular nerve appears to be an effective treatment for painful KOA, but targeting additional sensory nerves may further improve treatment success. Although genicular RFA appears relatively safe on the basis of the available data, additional large-scale studies are needed to provide greater confidence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Conger","given":"Aaron"},{"family":"Gililland","given":"Jeremy"},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Lucas"},{"family":"Pelt","given":"Christopher E"},{"family":"Peters","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"McCormick","given":"Zachary L"}],"citation-key":"congerGenicularNerveRadiofrequency2021","container-title":"Pain Medicine","DOI":"10.1093/pm/pnab129","ISSN":"1526-2375, 1526-4637","issue":"Supplement_1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,25]]},"language":"en","page":"S20-S23","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Genicular Nerve Radiofrequency Ablation for the Treatment of Painful Knee Osteoarthritis: Current Evidence and Future Directions","title-short":"Genicular Nerve Radiofrequency Ablation for the Treatment of Painful Knee Osteoarthritis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/painmedicine/article/22/Supplement_1/S20/6328220","volume":"22"},{"id":"ConservativeManagementSymptomatic2013","abstract":"Conservative management of medial compartment knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a misleading term used to describe the application of medical, orthotic, and/or rehabilitative therapies exclusive of surgical interventions. The implication of this nomenclature is that these therapies offer satisfactory symptom relief, alter disease progression, and have limited side effects. Unfortunately, conservative therapeutic options possesses few, if any, characteristics of an ideal treatment, namely one that significantly alleviates pain, improves knee function, and reduces medial compartmental loading without adverse side effects. As uncompensated mechanical loading is a primary culprit in the development and progression of knee OA, we propose that the therapeutic perspective of conservative treatment should shift from pharmacological treatments, which have no influence on joint loading, minimal potential to alter joint function, substantial associated risks, and significant financial costs, towards minimally invasive load absorbing therapeutic interventions. A safe and effective minimally invasive medical device specifically engineered for symptomatic relief of medial knee OA by limiting joint contact forces has the potential to reduce the clinical and economic knee OA burden.

Diarrhea (68%), abdominal pain (62%), and weight loss (57%) were common. The common intestinal complications were occult (27%) and overt (40%) gastrointestinal bleeding and obstruction (28%). There were 141 (78%) and 41 (22%) with definite and probable Crohn's disease respectively. Of 147 (81%) available histopathology specimens (endoscopic biopsy in 110; 75%), 31 (21%) had granuloma. Seventy-one out of 166 (43%) had received anti-tuberculosis therapy in the past. Results from the Montreal classification were as follows: age at onset, A1:A2:A3 6%:64%:30%; location of disease, L1:L2:L3:L4 32%:41%:23%:4%, and disease behavior, B1:B2:B3 51%:24%:25%. Twenty-six (15%) and 31 (17%) patients had upper gastrointestinal and perianal modifiers. The drugs used were: aminosalicylates (128, 70%), steroids (76, 42%), azathioprine (53, 29%), methotrexate (4, 2%), and salazopyrine (14, 8%). Sixty-six (36%) patients underwent surgical treatment. We concluded that the phenotype of Crohn's disease in India is very similar to that described in other regions of Asia and the West, except for a delay in diagnosis and a more complicated disease at diagnosis.","author":[{"family":"Das","given":"Kshaunish"},{"family":"Ghoshal","given":"Uday C."},{"family":"Dhali","given":"Gopal K."},{"family":"Benjamin","given":"Jaya"},{"family":"Ahuja","given":"Vineet"},{"family":"Makharia","given":"Govind K."}],"citation-key":"dasCrohnDiseaseIndia2009","container-title":"Digestive Diseases and Sciences","container-title-short":"Dig Dis Sci","DOI":"10.1007/s10620-008-0469-6","ISSN":"1573-2568","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",5]]},"language":"eng","page":"1099-1107","PMID":"18770037","source":"PubMed","title":"Crohn's disease in India: a multicenter study from a country where tuberculosis is endemic","title-short":"Crohn's disease in India","type":"article-journal","volume":"54"},{"id":"dasCrohnDiseaseIndia2009a","author":[{"family":"Das","given":"K."},{"family":"Ghoshal","given":"U.C."},{"family":"Dhali","given":"G.K."},{"family":"Benjamin","given":"J."},{"family":"Ahuja","given":"V."},{"family":"Makharia","given":"G.K."}],"citation-key":"dasCrohnDiseaseIndia2009a","container-title":"Dig Dis Sci","DOI":"10.1007/s10620-008-0469-6.","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",5,5]]},"language":"en","PMID":"18770037","title":"Crohn's disease in India: a multicenter study from a country where tuberculosis is endemic","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"debnathLipomaParotidGland2010","abstract":"Lipoma of the parotid gland is a rare clinical entity.

Aims: This study aimed to assess the presentation variability of head and neck lipomas as well as the relative importance and efﬁciency of pre-operative diagnostic methods used. Materials and methods: A retrospective review was undertaken of medical records and imaging studies of 24 patients with histopathologically proven head and neck lipomas, over a three-year period.\nResults: The 24 patients had 26 lipomas. Men predominated (62.5 per cent). The posterior subcutaneous neck was the most common site. Three patients had deep lipomas affecting the hypopharynx, larynx and parotid gland; all were correctly diagnosed pre-operatively. Computed tomography (CT) scan with speciﬁc radiodensity recording was the preferred pre-operative investigation.\nConclusions: Lipomas should be considered in the differential diagnosis of soft-tissue head and neck masses even in rare locations. A CT or magnetic resonance imaging scan can correctly diagnose a lipoma pre-operatively, thereby allowing better treatment planning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"El-Monem","given":"Mohamed H Abd"},{"family":"Gaafar","given":"Alaa H"},{"family":"Magdy","given":"Emad A"}],"citation-key":"el-monemLipomasHeadNeck2006","container-title":"The Journal of Laryngology & Otology","container-title-short":"J.

We report a 10-year experience in a single institution (La Timone University Hospital of Marseille, France). Among 614 parotidectomies for neoplasms performed from 1998 to 2008, 12 lipomas were identified. A retrospective analysis based on medical records was made. Evaluation, analysis and current management of lipomas of the parotid gland are described. Lipomas accounted for 2% of all parotid neoplasms and 2.6% of benign tumors in our series. The median age of patients was 60 years with a M/F sex ratio of 5-1. The main presentation was a soft asymptomatic, slow-growing, mobile mass although 30% had an indurated mass on palpation. Diagnosis of lipoma, based on the results of imaging, was made preoperatively in all cases. The mean tumor duration prior to excision was 11.5 months. The surgical decision was made regarding increased swelling with functional/esthetic discomfort in 83% of cases. Partial parotidectomy was performed in most cases. Postoperative complications occurred in 16% of cases although no permanent complication was observed. No recurrence was observed in our series. Histologically, 92% of tumors were classic lipomas. Lipomas can be clinically misleading since 30% of patients in our series showed an indurated mass on palpation. Preoperative imaging, especially MRI, is the cornerstone of their management as it allows very accurate lipoma diagnosis. Since in our series, diagnosis of lipoma had been made preoperatively in all cases, the surgical excision could be delayed and finally surgical decision has been made for esthetic and/or functional considerations in more than 80% of cases.","author":[{"family":"Fakhry","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Michel","given":"Justin"},{"family":"Varoquaux","given":"Arthur"},{"family":"Antonini","given":"François"},{"family":"Santini","given":"Laure"},{"family":"Lagier","given":"Aude"},{"family":"Turner","given":"Florence"},{"family":"Dessi","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Giovanni","given":"Antoine"}],"citation-key":"fakhrySurgicalExcisionLipomas2012","container-title":"European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology: official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS): affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery","container-title-short":"Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol","DOI":"10.1007/s00405-011-1843-0","ISSN":"1434-4726","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",7]]},"language":"eng","page":"1839-1844","PMID":"22116381","source":"PubMed","title":"Is surgical excision of lipomas arising from the parotid gland systematically required?","type":"article-journal","volume":"269"},{"id":"ganjiExtrapulmonaryTuberculosisAre2020","abstract":"Background: Aim of the study was to determine if extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) is a communicable disease as commonly perceived or a disease of host immune dysfunction.Methods: Patients with clinical suspicion of EPTB, in general surgery and orthopaedic department of twin hospitals of Deccan College of Medical Sciences, between the period of January 2015 and December 2017, were investigated appropriately and those found to have confirmed TB were enrolled in the study and followed up for 1 year.Simultaneously patient’s details registered under RNTCP in the two local community health centres were collected and compared with the hospital based study.Results: Of 319 patients with clinical features, 267 were confirmed with EPTB- maximum number with lymph nodal disease (127) followed by extremity bone and joint (63), spine (38), skin and soft tissues (25) and abdominal tb (19).

This disease may be because of excessive use of saturated animal fat and vegetable oil. Peritonitis was the 2nd commonest cause of abdominal surgery. Among the causes of peritonitis, peptic ulcer perforations were the frequent followed by enteric and appendicular perforations. Appendicitis was the 3rd commonest cause of abdominal surgery. Nepal, being a Hindu country, people consume excessive amount of meat, and possibly due to this, the disease of the appendix was very high as compared to other Asian countries where people live on bulk cellulose diet.","author":[{"family":"Khan","given":"S."},{"family":"Khan","given":"I.

There are various etiological factors contributing to the intestinal pathologies wherein the patient might present with intestinal obstruction or peritonitis. However, there are very few published articles describing the type of intestinal resection and correlating it with etiological factors and post-operative HPE. Therefore, our study aims to include the above criteria and its relation with southern India and how it differs from other parts of India and the rest of the world. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of HPE reports of resected bowel segments which were collected from patient records who underwent intestinal resections. Data was subsequently analyzed, the factors beginning from the diagnosis to post-op recovery were evaluated. Results: Of the 97 patients included in the study 30 presented with AIO (Acute Intestinal Obstruction) followed by 23 with SAIO (Subacute Intestinal Obstruction) and 21 with peritonitis. During laparotomy, the most common finding was tumor followed by stricture and perforation. Ileum was the most common anatomical location of pathology as well as the cause of morbidity and mortality. Patients with ileostomy had the highest rate of mortality. Conclusion: The disease demographic is highly site and time-specific and surgeons should be ready to adapt and change their approach to management. In the setting of intestinal perforations, not all ileal perforations are due to typhoid and ileostomy doesn’t always save lives. The leading cause of non-adhesive intestinal obstruction is a tumor and a general surgeon should be in a position to do a right hemicolectomy or at least an ileocecal resection in the emergency setting followed by an anastomosis to expect a reasonably good outcome in the patient population presenting to the general surgery department.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Mahin Hashmi","given":""},{"family":"G.

In addition, lipomas involving the deep parotid lobe are extremely unusual. That is why lipomas are not often considered for differential diagnosis of parotid lumps. Concerning diagnostic tools, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is nowadays considered as the main imaging examination for parotid lipomas due to a characteristic signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted images. Furthermore, even if the cost of MRI is nearly three times that of computed tomography, MRI is accurate, safe, and has few biological costs for the patient. In this reported case, MRI provided all information for either diagnosis or preoperative planning being the best diagnostic tool regarding tumor margin characteristics and surrounding tissues’ involvement. Concerning treatment, surgical excision of parotid masses is always mandatory for definitive diagnosis, but it is challenging because of the facial nerve. For this reason, a well-established surgical technique is mandatory for success.

We report a rare case of head and neck region lipoma between the superficial and deep lobe of the parotid gland. A 44-year-old female patient was presented with the chief complaint of a painless lump on the left front ear to the left cheek for about 1 year. There were no complaints of tooth pain before the lump appeared, and there were no lumps in other regions. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging were all performed to establish the preoperative diagnosis and to plan the correct surgical approach. Lipoma was the initial clinical diagnosis, and a surgical excision with superficial parotidectomy and facialis nerve preservation was performed. Follow-up examinations were conducted to assess any facial nerve injury complications. Conclusion Lipoma rarely grows in the parotid gland.

The aim of this study was to identify the etiology, clinical presentation, management and outcomes of patients with acute mechanical IO presenting in Jodhpur, Rajasthan.Methods: A prospective study was conducted at Mahatma Gandhi Hospital and Mathura Das Mathur Hospital (associated with Dr. SN Medical College), Jodhpur, Rajasthan. 100 patients with acute intestinal obstruction were admitted and evaluated. Blood routine, X-Ray abdomen, USG abdomen and CECT (if required) were done. A pre-operative diagnosis was made. Intra-operative findings and Post-operative complications were noted and follow up was done till the patient was discharged from the hospital.Results: A total of 69 male and 31 female patients, presented with acute mechanical IO during the period of the study. Mean patient age was 48.5 years with peak incidence in those aged 31-45 years. The foremost signs and symptoms were abdominal distension (88%), obstipation (87%), abdominal pain (81%) and nausea/ vomiting (47%). Adhesions and bands (29%), hernia (13%), neoplasm (9%) and pseudo-obstruction (8%) were the leading causes of intestinal obstruction. The sensitivity of X-ray and USG in present study was 67% and 75% respectively. Most common complication associated was wound infection (17%) followed by paralytic ileus (7%) and respiratory tract infections (6%). Late presentation was associated with poor prognosis. 4 patients expired before surgery. Post-operative mortality was associated with 6 patients and was more common in cases which presented with gangrenous bowel.Conclusions: The most common causes of IO in this study were adhesions and bands, hernia, neoplasm and pseudo-obstruction.

Several screening tests are available, and various professional organizations have differing recommendations on which screening test to use. Clinicians are challenged to ensure that eligible patients undergo colorectal cancer screening and to guide patients in choosing what tests to receive.\nOBJECTIVE: To critically assess the evidence for use of the available colorectal cancer screening tests, including fecal occult blood tests, sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, double-contrast barium enema, and newer tests, such as virtual colonoscopy and stool-based molecular screening.\nDATA SOURCES: All relevant English-language articles were identified using PubMed (January 1966-August 2002), published meta-analyses, reference lists of key articles, and expert consultation.\nDATA EXTRACTION: Studies that evaluated colorectal cancer screening in healthy individuals and assessed clinical outcomes were included. Evidence from randomized controlled trials was considered to be of highest quality, followed by observational evidence. Diagnostic accuracy studies were evaluated when randomized controlled trials and observational studies were not available or did not provide adequate evidence. Studies were excluded if they did not evaluate colorectal screening tests and if they did not evaluate average-risk individuals.\nDATA SYNTHESIS: Randomized controlled trials have shown that fecal occult blood testing can reduce colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. Case-control studies have shown that sigmoidoscopy is associated with a reduction in mortality, and observational studies suggest colonoscopy is effective as well. Combining fecal occult blood testing and sigmoidoscopy may decrease mortality and can increase diagnostic yield.\nCONCLUSION: The recommendation that all men and women aged 50 years or older undergo screening for colorectal cancer is supported by a large body of direct and indirect evidence. At present, the available evidence does not currently support choosing one test over another.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Walsh","given":"Judith M.

The spectrum of etiology of perforation peritonitis in tropical countries continues to differ from its western counterpart. This study was conducted at Hindu Rao Hospital, Municipal Corporation of Delhi, New Delhi, India, designed to highlight the spectrum of perforation peritonitis in the eastern countries and to improve its outcome. This prospective study included 77 consecutive patients of perforation peritonitis studied in terms of clinical presentations, causes, site of perforation, surgical treatment, postoperative complications, and mortality at Hindu Rao Hospital, Delhi, from March 1, 2011 to December 1, 2011, over a period of 8 months. All patients were resuscitated and underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy. On laparotomy cause of perforation peritonitis was found and controlled. The most common cause of perforation peritonitis noticed in our series was perforated duodenal ulcer (26.4 %) and ileal typhoid perforation (26.4 %), each followed by small bowel tuberculosis (10.3 %) and stomach perforation (9.2 %), perforation due to acute appendicitis (5 %). The highest number of perforations was seen in ileum (39.1 %), duodenum (26.4 %), stomach (11.5 %), appendix (3.5 %), jejunum (4.6 %), and colon (3.5 %). Overall mortality was 13 %. The spectrum of perforation peritonitis in India continuously differs from western countries. The highest number of perforations was noticed in the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract as compared to the western countries where the perforations seen mostly in the distal part. The most common cause of perforation peritonitis was perforated duodenal ulcer and small bowel typhoid perforation followed by typhoid perforation. Large bowel perforations and malignant perforations were least common in our setup.","author":[{"family":"Yadav","given":"Dinesh"},{"family":"Garg","given":"Puneet K."}],"citation-key":"yadavSpectrumPerforationPeritonitis2013","container-title":"The Indian Journal of Surgery","container-title-short":"Indian J Surg","DOI":"10.1007/s12262-012-0609-2","ISSN":"0972-2068","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",4]]},"language":"eng","page":"133-137","PMCID":"PMC3644151","PMID":"24426408","source":"PubMed","title":"Spectrum of perforation peritonitis in delhi: 77 cases experience","title-short":"Spectrum of perforation peritonitis in delhi","type":"article-journal","volume":"75"},{"id":"labatiAllIDBAcuteLymphoblastic2011","type":"paper-conference","container-title":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","DOI":"10.1109/ICIP.2011.6115881","event-place":"Brussels, Belgium","event-title":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP 2011)","ISBN":"978-1-4577-1303-3","page":"2045-2048","publisher":"IEEE","publisher-place":"Brussels, Belgium","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"All-IDB: The acute lymphoblastic leukemia image database for image processing","title-short":"All-IDB","URL":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6115881/","author":[{"family":"Labati","given":"Ruggero Donida"},{"family":"Piuri","given":"Vincenzo"},{"family":"Scotti","given":"Fabio"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,6]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",9]]},"citation-key":"labatiAllIDBAcuteLymphoblastic2011","library":"My Library","citekey":"labatiAllIDBAcuteLymphoblastic2011"},{"id":"vogadoDiagnosingLeukemiaBlood2017","type":"paper-conference","container-title":"2017 30th SIBGRAPI Conference on Graphics, Patterns and Images (SIBGRAPI)","DOI":"10.1109/SIBGRAPI.2017.55","event-place":"Niteroi","event-title":"2017 30th SIBGRAPI Conference on Graphics, Patterns and Images (SIBGRAPI)","ISBN":"978-1-5386-2219-3","page":"367-373","publisher":"IEEE","publisher-place":"Niteroi","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Diagnosing Leukemia in Blood Smear Images Using an Ensemble of Classifiers and Pre-Trained Convolutional Neural Networks","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8097335/","author":[{"family":"Vogado","given":"Luis H.S."},{"family":"Veras","given":"Rodrigo De M.S."},{"family":"Andrade","given":"Alan R."},{"family":"Araujo","given":"Flavio H.D.","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Silva","given":"Romuere R.V."},{"family":"Aires","given":"Kelson R.T."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,6]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",10]]},"citation-key":"vogadoDiagnosingLeukemiaBlood2017","library":"My Library","citekey":"vogadoDiagnosingLeukemiaBlood2017"},{"id":"elsalamonyHealthyUnhealthyRed2016","type":"article-journal","container-title":"Micron","DOI":"10.1016/j.micron.2016.01.008","ISSN":"09684328","journalAbbreviation":"Micron","language":"en","page":"32-41","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Healthy and unhealthy red blood cell detection in human blood smears using neural networks","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0968432816300087","volume":"83","author":[{"family":"Elsalamony","given":"Hany A."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,6]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",4]]},"citation-key":"elsalamonyHealthyUnhealthyRed2016","library":"My Library","citekey":"elsalamonyHealthyUnhealthyRed2016"},{"id":"rajaramanPretrainedConvolutionalNeural2018","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Malaria is a blood disease caused by the\n              Plasmodium\n              parasites transmitted through the bite of female Anopheles mosquito. Microscopists commonly examine thick and thin blood smears to diagnose disease and compute parasitemia. However, their accuracy depends on smear quality and expertise in classifying and counting parasitized and uninfected cells. Such an examination could be arduous for large-scale diagnoses resulting in poor quality. State-of-the-art image-analysis based computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) methods using machine learning (ML) techniques, applied to microscopic images of the smears using hand-engineered features demand expertise in analyzing morphological, textural, and positional variations of the region of interest (ROI). In contrast, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a class of deep learning (DL) models promise highly scalable and superior results with end-to-end feature extraction and classification. Automated malaria screening using DL techniques could, therefore, serve as an effective diagnostic aid. In this study, we evaluate the performance of pre-trained CNN based DL models as feature extractors toward classifying parasitized and uninfected cells to aid in improved disease screening. We experimentally determine the optimal model layers for feature extraction from the underlying data. Statistical validation of the results demonstrates the use of pre-trained CNNs as a promising tool for feature extraction for this purpose.","container-title":"PeerJ","DOI":"10.7717/peerj.4568","ISSN":"2167-8359","language":"en","page":"e4568","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Pre-trained convolutional neural networks as feature extractors toward improved malaria parasite detection in thin blood smear images","URL":"https://peerj.com/articles/4568","volume":"6","author":[{"family":"Rajaraman","given":"Sivaramakrishnan"},{"family":"Antani","given":"Sameer K."},{"family":"Poostchi","given":"Mahdieh"},{"family":"Silamut","given":"Kamolrat"},{"family":"Hossain","given":"Md.

So far it has not been possible to define the cellular mechanism underlying the neurodegenerative disease in life. We generated a machine learning-based model that can simultaneously predict the presence of disease and its primary mechanistic subtype in human neurons. We used stem cell technology to derive control or patient-derived neurons, and generated different disease subtypes through chemical induction or the presence of mutation. Multidimensional fluorescent labelling of organelles was performed in healthy control neurons and in four different disease subtypes, and both the quantitative single-cell fluorescence features and the images were used to independently train a series of classifiers to build deep neural networks. Quantitative cellular profile-based classifiers achieve an accuracy of 82%, whereas image-based deep neural networks predict control and four distinct disease subtypes with an accuracy of 95%. The machine learning-trained classifiers achieve their accuracy across all subtypes, using the organellar features of the mitochondria with the additional contribution of the lysosomes, confirming the biological importance of these pathways in Parkinson’s. Altogether, we show that machine learning approaches applied to patient-derived cells are highly accurate at predicting disease subtypes, providing proof of concept that this approach may enable mechanistic stratification and precision medicine approaches in the future.","container-title":"Nature Machine Intelligence","DOI":"10.1038/s42256-023-00702-9","ISSN":"2522-5839","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Prediction of mechanistic subtypes of Parkinson’s using patient-derived stem cell models | Nature Machine Intelligence","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-023-00702-9#article-info","author":[{"family":"D’Sa","given":"Karishma"},{"family":"Evans","given":"James R."},{"family":"Virdi","given":"Gurvir S."},{"family":"Vecchi","given":"Giulia"},{"family":"Adam","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Bertolli","given":"Ottavia"},{"family":"Fleming","given":"James"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Hojong"},{"family":"Leighton","given":"Craig"},{"family":"Horrocks","given":"Mathew H."},{"family":"Athauda","given":"Dilan"},{"family":"Choi","given":"Minee L."},{"family":"Gandhi","given":"Sonia"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,13]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,10]]},"citation-key":"dsaPredictionMechanisticSubtypes2023","library":"My Library","citekey":"dsaPredictionMechanisticSubtypes2023"},{"id":"kuntzGastrointestinalCancerClassification2021","type":"article-journal","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal cancers account for approximately 20% of all cancer diagnoses and are responsible for 22.5% of cancer deaths worldwide. Artificial intelligence-based diagnostic support systems, in particular convolutional neural network (CNN)-based image analysis tools, have shown great potential in medical computer vision. In this systematic review, we summarise recent studies reporting CNN-based approaches for digital biomarkers for characterization and prognostication of gastrointestinal cancer pathology.\nMETHODS: Pubmed and Medline were screened for peer-reviewed papers dealing with CNN-based gastrointestinal cancer analyses from histological slides, published between 2015 and 2020.Seven hundred and ninety titles and abstracts were screened, and 58 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility.\nRESULTS: Sixteen publications fulfilled our inclusion criteria dealing with tumor or precursor lesion characterization or prognostic and predictive biomarkers: 14 studies on colorectal or rectal cancer, three studies on gastric cancer and none on esophageal cancer. These studies were categorised according to their end-points: polyp characterization, tumor characterization and patient outcome. Regarding the translation into clinical practice, we identified several studies demonstrating generalization of the classifier with external tests and comparisons with pathologists, but none presenting clinical implementation.\nCONCLUSIONS: Results of recent studies on CNN-based image analysis in gastrointestinal cancer pathology are promising, but studies were conducted in observational and retrospective settings. Large-scale trials are needed to assess performance and predict clinical usefulness. Furthermore, large-scale trials are required for approval of CNN-based prediction models as medical devices.","container-title":"European Journal of Cancer (Oxford, England: 1990)","DOI":"10.1016/j.ejca.2021.07.012","ISSN":"1879-0852","journalAbbreviation":"Eur J Cancer","language":"eng","note":"PMID: 34391053","page":"200-215","source":"PubMed","title":"Gastrointestinal cancer classification and prognostication from histology using deep learning: Systematic review","title-short":"Gastrointestinal cancer classification and prognostication from histology using deep learning","volume":"155","author":[{"family":"Kuntz","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Krieghoff-Henning","given":"Eva"},{"family":"Kather","given":"Jakob N."},{"family":"Jutzi","given":"Tanja"},{"family":"Höhn","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Kiehl","given":"Lennard"},{"family":"Hekler","given":"Achim"},{"family":"Alwers","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Kalle","given":"Christof","non-dropping-particle":"von"},{"family":"Fröhling","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Utikal","given":"Jochen S."},{"family":"Brenner","given":"Hermann"},{"family":"Hoffmeister","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Brinker","given":"Titus J."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9]]},"citation-key":"kuntzGastrointestinalCancerClassification2021","library":"My Library","citekey":"kuntzGastrointestinalCancerClassification2021"}]
