For comparison of performance, CA19-9 was assayed in blinded independent sets of samples collected at diagnosis from 129 subjects with resectable pancreatic cancer and 275 controls (100 healthy subjects; 50 with chronic pancreatitis; and 125 with noncancerous pancreatic cysts). The complementary value of 2 additional protein markers, TIMP1 and LRG1, was determined.\nRESULTS: In the PLCO cohort, levels of CA19-9 increased exponentially starting at 2 years before diagnosis with sensitivities reaching 60% at 99% specificity within 0 to 6 months before diagnosis for all cases and 50% at 99% specificity for cases diagnosed with early-stage disease. Performance was comparable for distinguishing newly diagnosed cases with resectable pancreatic cancer from healthy controls (64% sensitivity at 99% specificity). Comparison of resectable pancreatic cancer cases to subjects with chronic pancreatitis yielded 46% sensitivity at 99% specificity and for subjects with noncancerous cysts, 30% sensitivity at 99% specificity. For prediagnostic cases below cutoff value for CA19-9, the combination with LRG1 and TIMP1 yielded an increment of 13.2% in sensitivity at 99% specificity (P = .031) in identifying cases diagnosed within 1 year of blood collection.\nCONCLUSION: CA19-9 can serve as an anchor marker for pancreatic cancer early detection applications.","author":[{"family":"Fahrmann","given":"Johannes F."},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"C.

Unfortunately, 80%-85% of patients present with locally advanced or metastatic unresectable pancreatic cancer at the time of diagnosis. Detection of pancreatic cancer at early stages remains a great challenge due to lack of accurate detection tests. Recommendations in existing clinical practice guidelines on early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer are inconsistent and based on limited evidence. Most of them endorse measuring serum CA19-9 as a complementary test, but also state that it is not recommended for diagnosing early pancreatic cancer. There are currently no other tumour-specific markers recommended for diagnosing early pancreatic cancer. This study aims to evaluate and compare the accuracy of five common tumour biomarkers (CA242,carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA)), CA125, microRNAs and K-ras gene mutation) and CA19-9 and their combinations for diagnosing pancreatic cancer using network meta-analysis method, and to rank these tests using a superiority index.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials will be searched from inception to April 2017. The search will include the above-mentioned tumour biomarkers for diagnosing pancreatic cancer, including CA19-9. The risk of bias for each study will be independently assessed as low, moderate or high using criteria adapted from the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2. Network meta-analysis will be performed using STATA V.12.0 and R software V.3.4.1.

The disease itself is associated with a dismal prognosis, partly due to its silent nature resulting in patients presenting with advanced disease at the time of diagnosis. To combat this, there has been an explosion in the last decade of potential candidate biomarkers in the research setting in the hope that a diagnostic biomarker may provide a glimmer of hope in what is otherwise quite a substantial clinical dilemma. Currently, serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 is utilized in the diagnostic work-up of patients diagnosed with PC however this biomarker lacks the sensitivity and specificity associated with a gold-standard marker. In the search for a biomarker that is both sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of PC, there has been a paradigm shift towards a focus on liquid biopsy and the use of diagnostic panels which has subsequently proved to have efficacy in the diagnosis of PC. Currently, promising developments in the field of early detection on PC using diagnostic biomarkers include the detection of microRNA (miRNA) in serum and circulating tumour cells. Both these modalities, although in their infancy and yet to be widely accepted into routine clinical practice, possess merit in the early detection of PC. We reviewed over 300 biomarkers with the aim to provide an in-depth summary of the current state-of-play regarding diagnostic biomarkers in PC (serum, urinary, salivary, faecal, pancreatic juice and biliary fluid).","author":[{"family":"O'Neill","given":"Robert S."},{"family":"Stoita","given":"Alina"}],"citation-key":"oneillBiomarkersDiagnosisPancreatic2021","container-title":"World Journal of Gastroenterology","container-title-short":"World J Gastroenterol","DOI":"10.3748/wjg.v27.i26.4045","ISSN":"2219-2840","issue":"26","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,14]]},"language":"eng","page":"4045-4087","PMCID":"PMC8311531","PMID":"34326612","source":"PubMed","title":"Biomarkers in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer: Are we closer to finding the golden ticket?","title-short":"Biomarkers in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"27"},{"id":"patelEpidermalInclusionCyst2006","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Patel","given":"Keyur"},{"family":"Bhuiya","given":"Tawfiqul"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Sheng"},{"family":"Kenan","given":"Samuel"},{"family":"Kahn","given":"Leonard"}],"citation-key":"patelEpidermalInclusionCyst2006","container-title":"Skeletal Radiology","container-title-short":"Skeletal Radiol","DOI":"10.1007/s00256-005-0058-0","ISSN":"0364-2348, 1432-2161","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",10,11]]},"language":"en","license":"http://www.springer.com/tdm","page":"861-863","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Epidermal inclusion cyst of phalanx: a case report and review of the literature","title-short":"Epidermal inclusion cyst of phalanx","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00256-005-0058-0","volume":"35"},{"id":"safwanUnusualGiantPlunging2024","abstract":"Key Clinical Message\n              When treating a painless or asymptomatic mass in the submental or floor of the mouth, sublingual epidermoid cyst should be considered.

Importantly, it exhibits a dramatic increase in its plasmatic levels during neoplastic disease. However, several critical aspects for its clinical use, such as false negative results in subjects with Lewis (a-b-) genotype and false positive elevation, occasional and transient, in patients with benign diseases, together with its poor positive predictive value (72.3 %), do not make it a good cancer-specific marker and renders it impotent as a screening tool.

The findings of the subgroup analyses suggested that different cutoff values of CA 19-9 and CEA might affect the diagnostic value.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study indicated that CA 19-9 levels were associated with higher sensitivity, DOR, and AUC compared with the corresponding levels of CEA with regard to the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.","author":[{"family":"Xing","given":"Haibo"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yanling"},{"family":"Tong","given":"Mengting"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Hong"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Changxin"},{"family":"Li","given":"Da"}],"citation-key":"xingDiagnosticValueCA2018","container-title":"Gastroenterology Research and Practice","container-title-short":"Gastroenterol Res Pract","DOI":"10.1155/2018/8704751","ISSN":"1687-6121","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"eng","page":"8704751","PMCID":"PMC6280291","PMID":"30584422","source":"PubMed","title":"Diagnostic Value of CA 19-9 and Carcinoembryonic Antigen for Pancreatic Cancer: A Meta-Analysis","title-short":"Diagnostic Value of CA 19-9 and Carcinoembryonic Antigen for Pancreatic Cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"2018"},{"id":"zadekEpidermoidCystTerminal1953","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Zadek","given":"Isadore"},{"family":"Cohen","given":"Herbert G."}],"citation-key":"zadekEpidermoidCystTerminal1953","container-title":"The American Journal of Surgery","container-title-short":"The American Journal of Surgery","DOI":"10.1016/0002-9610(53)90566-2","ISSN":"00029610","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1953",6]]},"language":"en","license":"https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/","page":"771-774","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Epidermoid cyst of the terminal phalanx of a finger","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0002961053905662","volume":"85"},{"id":"labatiAllIDBAcuteLymphoblastic2011","type":"paper-conference","container-title":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","DOI":"10.1109/ICIP.2011.6115881","event-place":"Brussels, Belgium","event-title":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP 2011)","ISBN":"978-1-4577-1303-3","page":"2045-2048","publisher":"IEEE","publisher-place":"Brussels, Belgium","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"All-IDB: The acute lymphoblastic leukemia image database for image processing","title-short":"All-IDB","URL":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6115881/","author":[{"family":"Labati","given":"Ruggero Donida"},{"family":"Piuri","given":"Vincenzo"},{"family":"Scotti","given":"Fabio"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,6]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",9]]},"citation-key":"labatiAllIDBAcuteLymphoblastic2011","library":"My Library","citekey":"labatiAllIDBAcuteLymphoblastic2011"},{"id":"vogadoDiagnosingLeukemiaBlood2017","type":"paper-conference","container-title":"2017 30th SIBGRAPI Conference on Graphics, Patterns and Images (SIBGRAPI)","DOI":"10.1109/SIBGRAPI.2017.55","event-place":"Niteroi","event-title":"2017 30th SIBGRAPI Conference on Graphics, Patterns and Images (SIBGRAPI)","ISBN":"978-1-5386-2219-3","page":"367-373","publisher":"IEEE","publisher-place":"Niteroi","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Diagnosing Leukemia in Blood Smear Images Using an Ensemble of Classifiers and Pre-Trained Convolutional Neural Networks","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8097335/","author":[{"family":"Vogado","given":"Luis H.S."},{"family":"Veras","given":"Rodrigo De M.S."},{"family":"Andrade","given":"Alan R."},{"family":"Araujo","given":"Flavio H.D.","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Silva","given":"Romuere R.V."},{"family":"Aires","given":"Kelson R.T."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,6]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",10]]},"citation-key":"vogadoDiagnosingLeukemiaBlood2017","library":"My Library","citekey":"vogadoDiagnosingLeukemiaBlood2017"},{"id":"elsalamonyHealthyUnhealthyRed2016","type":"article-journal","container-title":"Micron","DOI":"10.1016/j.micron.2016.01.008","ISSN":"09684328","journalAbbreviation":"Micron","language":"en","page":"32-41","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Healthy and unhealthy red blood cell detection in human blood smears using neural networks","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0968432816300087","volume":"83","author":[{"family":"Elsalamony","given":"Hany A."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,6]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",4]]},"citation-key":"elsalamonyHealthyUnhealthyRed2016","library":"My Library","citekey":"elsalamonyHealthyUnhealthyRed2016"},{"id":"rajaramanPretrainedConvolutionalNeural2018","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Malaria is a blood disease caused by the\n              Plasmodium\n              parasites transmitted through the bite of female Anopheles mosquito. Microscopists commonly examine thick and thin blood smears to diagnose disease and compute parasitemia. However, their accuracy depends on smear quality and expertise in classifying and counting parasitized and uninfected cells. Such an examination could be arduous for large-scale diagnoses resulting in poor quality. State-of-the-art image-analysis based computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) methods using machine learning (ML) techniques, applied to microscopic images of the smears using hand-engineered features demand expertise in analyzing morphological, textural, and positional variations of the region of interest (ROI). In contrast, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a class of deep learning (DL) models promise highly scalable and superior results with end-to-end feature extraction and classification. Automated malaria screening using DL techniques could, therefore, serve as an effective diagnostic aid. In this study, we evaluate the performance of pre-trained CNN based DL models as feature extractors toward classifying parasitized and uninfected cells to aid in improved disease screening. We experimentally determine the optimal model layers for feature extraction from the underlying data. Statistical validation of the results demonstrates the use of pre-trained CNNs as a promising tool for feature extraction for this purpose.","container-title":"PeerJ","DOI":"10.7717/peerj.4568","ISSN":"2167-8359","language":"en","page":"e4568","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Pre-trained convolutional neural networks as feature extractors toward improved malaria parasite detection in thin blood smear images","URL":"https://peerj.com/articles/4568","volume":"6","author":[{"family":"Rajaraman","given":"Sivaramakrishnan"},{"family":"Antani","given":"Sameer K."},{"family":"Poostchi","given":"Mahdieh"},{"family":"Silamut","given":"Kamolrat"},{"family":"Hossain","given":"Md.

So far it has not been possible to define the cellular mechanism underlying the neurodegenerative disease in life. We generated a machine learning-based model that can simultaneously predict the presence of disease and its primary mechanistic subtype in human neurons. We used stem cell technology to derive control or patient-derived neurons, and generated different disease subtypes through chemical induction or the presence of mutation. Multidimensional fluorescent labelling of organelles was performed in healthy control neurons and in four different disease subtypes, and both the quantitative single-cell fluorescence features and the images were used to independently train a series of classifiers to build deep neural networks. Quantitative cellular profile-based classifiers achieve an accuracy of 82%, whereas image-based deep neural networks predict control and four distinct disease subtypes with an accuracy of 95%. The machine learning-trained classifiers achieve their accuracy across all subtypes, using the organellar features of the mitochondria with the additional contribution of the lysosomes, confirming the biological importance of these pathways in Parkinson’s. Altogether, we show that machine learning approaches applied to patient-derived cells are highly accurate at predicting disease subtypes, providing proof of concept that this approach may enable mechanistic stratification and precision medicine approaches in the future.","container-title":"Nature Machine Intelligence","DOI":"10.1038/s42256-023-00702-9","ISSN":"2522-5839","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Prediction of mechanistic subtypes of Parkinson’s using patient-derived stem cell models | Nature Machine Intelligence","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-023-00702-9#article-info","author":[{"family":"D’Sa","given":"Karishma"},{"family":"Evans","given":"James R."},{"family":"Virdi","given":"Gurvir S."},{"family":"Vecchi","given":"Giulia"},{"family":"Adam","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Bertolli","given":"Ottavia"},{"family":"Fleming","given":"James"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Hojong"},{"family":"Leighton","given":"Craig"},{"family":"Horrocks","given":"Mathew H."},{"family":"Athauda","given":"Dilan"},{"family":"Choi","given":"Minee L."},{"family":"Gandhi","given":"Sonia"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,13]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,10]]},"citation-key":"dsaPredictionMechanisticSubtypes2023","library":"My Library","citekey":"dsaPredictionMechanisticSubtypes2023"},{"id":"kuntzGastrointestinalCancerClassification2021","type":"article-journal","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal cancers account for approximately 20% of all cancer diagnoses and are responsible for 22.5% of cancer deaths worldwide. Artificial intelligence-based diagnostic support systems, in particular convolutional neural network (CNN)-based image analysis tools, have shown great potential in medical computer vision. In this systematic review, we summarise recent studies reporting CNN-based approaches for digital biomarkers for characterization and prognostication of gastrointestinal cancer pathology.\nMETHODS: Pubmed and Medline were screened for peer-reviewed papers dealing with CNN-based gastrointestinal cancer analyses from histological slides, published between 2015 and 2020.Seven hundred and ninety titles and abstracts were screened, and 58 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility.\nRESULTS: Sixteen publications fulfilled our inclusion criteria dealing with tumor or precursor lesion characterization or prognostic and predictive biomarkers: 14 studies on colorectal or rectal cancer, three studies on gastric cancer and none on esophageal cancer. These studies were categorised according to their end-points: polyp characterization, tumor characterization and patient outcome. Regarding the translation into clinical practice, we identified several studies demonstrating generalization of the classifier with external tests and comparisons with pathologists, but none presenting clinical implementation.\nCONCLUSIONS: Results of recent studies on CNN-based image analysis in gastrointestinal cancer pathology are promising, but studies were conducted in observational and retrospective settings. Large-scale trials are needed to assess performance and predict clinical usefulness. Furthermore, large-scale trials are required for approval of CNN-based prediction models as medical devices.","container-title":"European Journal of Cancer (Oxford, England:

their occurrence in the head and neck is rare, even more at the level of the parotid region where they can be found nearby the parotid capsule, inside the capsule, or within the gland. In addition, lipomas involving the deep parotid lobe are extremely unusual. That is why lipomas are not often considered for differential diagnosis of parotid lumps. Concerning diagnostic tools, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is nowadays considered as the main imaging examination for parotid lipomas due to a characteristic signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted images. Furthermore, even if the cost of MRI is nearly three times that of computed tomography, MRI is accurate, safe, and has few biological costs for the patient. In this reported case, MRI provided all information for either diagnosis or preoperative planning being the best diagnostic tool regarding tumor margin characteristics and surrounding tissues’ involvement. Concerning treatment, surgical excision of parotid masses is always mandatory for definitive diagnosis, but it is challenging because of the facial nerve. For this reason, a well-established surgical technique is mandatory for success. The authors present a rare case of parotid gland lipoma arising from the deep lobe and discuss diagnostic tools and surgical technique.","container-title":"Annals of Maxillofacial Surgery","DOI":"10.4103/2231-0746.200335","ISSN":"2231-0746","issue":"2","journalAbbreviation":"Ann Maxillofac Surg","note":"PMID: 28299278\nPMCID: PMC5343648","page":"308-310","source":"PubMed Central","title":"A rare case of parotid gland lipoma arising from the deep lobe of the parotid gland","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5343648/","volume":"6","author":[{"family":"Paparo","given":"Francesco"},{"family":"Massarelli","given":"Mauro"},{"family":"Giuliani","given":"Giorgio"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,25]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"citation-key":"paparoRareCaseParotid2016","library":"Surgery Group","citekey":"paparoRareCaseParotid2016"}]
