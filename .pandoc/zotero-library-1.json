Though documented, its association with Graves’ disease is not very common and can easily be missed or misdiagnosed, leading to excessive bleeding and mortality. Treatment with steroids and antithyroid medications has been shown to be beneficial in correcting thrombocytopenia in these patients, although the response is varied. We report on a patient with Graves’ disease who presents with immune thrombocytopenic purpura.\n            \n            \n              Case presentation\n              A 37-year-old Ghanaian female presented to our hospital’s emergency department with a complaint of palpitations, difficulty breathing, easy fatigue, and headaches. She had been referred from a peripheral hospital as a case of thrombocytopenia, severe anemia, and anterior neck swelling. She was diagnosed with Graves’ disease 2 years ago, became euthyroid during treatment, but defaulted. On further examination and investigation, she was diagnosed with immune thrombocytopenic purpura and was also found to have elevated free T3 and T4, and suppressed thyroid stimulating hormone. She also had high thyroid autoantibodies. She was initially started on oral prednisolone but there was no stabilization of platelets until methimazole was introduced, which improved and normalized her platelet count.\n            \n            \n              Conclusion\n              The association of Graves’ disease with immune thrombocytopenic purpura, though documented, is uncommon, and very few cases have been reported thus far. There have not been any reported cases in Ghana or Sub-Saharan Africa and hence, clinicians should be aware of this association when investigating immune thrombocytopenic purpura and should consider Graves’ disease as a possible cause. From this study, we observed that there was no improvement in platelet count following the use of corticosteroid therapy until methimazole was started.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Agyapong","given":"Kwabena Oteng"},{"family":"Folson","given":"Aba A."},{"family":"Fiador","given":"Kate"},{"family":"Kootin-Sanwu","given":"Cecilia"},{"family":"Tufuor","given":"Martha"},{"family":"Bampoh","given":"Sally Afua"},{"family":"Fiscian","given":"Henrietta"},{"family":"Wonkyi","given":"Roland"}],"citation-key":"agyapongGravesDiseaseinducedImmune2023","container-title":"Journal of Medical Case Reports","container-title-short":"J Med Case Reports","DOI":"10.1186/s13256-023-03869-2","ISSN":"1752-1947","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,5]]},"language":"en","page":"122","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Graves’ disease-induced immune thrombocytopenic purpura in an African female: a case report","title-short":"Graves’ disease-induced immune thrombocytopenic purpura in an African female","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13256-023-03869-2","volume":"17"},

  {"id":"alviParotidCancer2024","abstract":"Salivary gland neoplasms may be benign or malignant, and malignant tumors can be primary or metastatic. Due to the epithelial and the non-epithelial histology of the affected organ, many histological types of parotid tumors are possible, although some are rare. Salivary gland tumors are characterized by diverse histological appearances and variable biological behavior. The distinction between tumor types can be difficult, particularly based on material from fine-needle aspiration (FNA). There are several other aspects of salivary gland tumors that make them interesting. The commonest benign tumor (pleomorphic adenoma) has a malignant transformation potential, and, although considered benign, there is a propensity for recurrence after treatment. It is not surprising that with such a wealth of pathology, clinical features, investigation issues, and contentious treatment options that salivary gland neoplasms are regularly used in clinical examinations. Malignant salivary gland tumors usually present after the 6th decade of life, whereas benign lesions present in the 4-5th decade of life. Benign lesions tend to be more common in women, but malignant lesions tend to occur with equal frequency in both genders.  The majority of salivary gland tumors occur in the parotid, about 10% occur in the submandibular gland, and less than 4% occur in the minor salivary glands. Most parotid gland tumors are benign, of which the most important is the pleomorphic adenoma. On the other hand, lesions occurring in the submandibular gland and the minor salivary glands are more likely to be malignant. Mortality from salivary gland tumors depends on the stage. Five-year survival averages about 70%.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Alvi","given":"Sirhan"},{"family":"Chudek","given":"Dorota"},{"family":"Limaiem","given":"Faten"}],"call-number":"NBK538340","citation-key":"alviParotidCancer2024","event-place":"Treasure Island (FL)","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"language":"eng","license":"Copyright © 2024, StatPearls Publishing LLC.","PMID":"30855924","publisher":"StatPearls Publishing","publisher-place":"Treasure Island (FL)","source":"PubMed","title":"Parotid Cancer","type":"chapter","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538340/"},

This clinical setting further complicates the critical point of parotid surgery, which is the management of the facial nerve. In the present study, data were evaluated referring to 540 patients who underwent parotidectomy for a mass which was discovered to be a benign (470 cases) or a malignant (70 cases) neoplasm, between November 1994 and December 2007, at our Institution. The most significant single parameter in this series of malignancies regarding disease specific survival was the clinical involvement of the facial nerve at diagnosis (p = 0.006). Also for this reason, as there is no evidence that liberal VIIth nerve sacrifice improves prognosis, when it is not clinically involved, every attempt is made to dissect and preserve it. At present, the most complicated situation concerning nerve preservation may be, on the other hand, recurrence of a benign tumour, in particular pleomorphic adenoma, which, in our series, has a higher incidence (8.3%) of permanent facial dysfunction, than surgery with nerve preservation for malignancy (3.7%).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,24]]},"author":[{"family":"BUSSU","given":"F."},{"family":"PARRILLA","given":"C."},{"family":"RIZZO","given":"D."},{"family":"ALMADORI","given":"G."},{"family":"PALUDETTI","given":"G."},{"family":"GALLI","given":"J."}],"citation-key":"bussuClinicalApproachTreatment2011","container-title":"Acta Otorhinolaryngologica Italica","container-title-short":"Acta Otorhinolaryngol Ital","ISSN":"0392-100X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",6]]},"page":"135-143","PMCID":"PMC3185824","PMID":"22058591","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Clinical approach and treatment of benign and malignant parotid masses, personal experience","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3185824/","volume":"31"},

So far it has not been possible to define the cellular mechanism underlying the neurodegenerative disease in life. We generated a machine learning-based model that can simultaneously predict the presence of disease and its primary mechanistic subtype in human neurons. We used stem cell technology to derive control or patient-derived neurons, and generated different disease subtypes through chemical induction or the presence of mutation. Multidimensional fluorescent labelling of organelles was performed in healthy control neurons and in four different disease subtypes, and both the quantitative single-cell fluorescence features and the images were used to independently train a series of classifiers to build deep neural networks. Quantitative cellular profile-based classifiers achieve an accuracy of 82%, whereas image-based deep neural networks predict control and four distinct disease subtypes with an accuracy of 95%. The machine learning-trained classifiers achieve their accuracy across all subtypes, using the organellar features of the mitochondria with the additional contribution of the lysosomes, confirming the biological importance of these pathways in Parkinson’s. Altogether, we show that machine learning approaches applied to patient-derived cells are highly accurate at predicting disease subtypes, providing proof of concept that this approach may enable mechanistic stratification and precision medicine approaches in the future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,13]]},"author":[{"family":"D’Sa","given":"Karishma"},{"family":"Evans","given":"James R."},{"family":"Virdi","given":"Gurvir S."},{"family":"Vecchi","given":"Giulia"},{"family":"Adam","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Bertolli","given":"Ottavia"},{"family":"Fleming","given":"James"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Hojong"},{"family":"Leighton","given":"Craig"},{"family":"Horrocks","given":"Mathew H."},{"family":"Athauda","given":"Dilan"},{"family":"Choi","given":"Minee L."},{"family":"Gandhi","given":"Sonia"}],"citation-key":"dsaPredictionMechanisticSubtypes2023","container-title":"Nature Machine Intelligence","DOI":"10.1038/s42256-023-00702-9","ISSN":"2522-5839","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,10]]},"source":"www.nature.com","title":"Prediction of mechanistic subtypes of Parkinson’s using patient-derived stem cell models | Nature Machine Intelligence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-023-00702-9#article-info"},

Men predominated (62.5 per cent). The posterior subcutaneous neck was the most common site. Three patients had deep lipomas affecting the hypopharynx, larynx and parotid gland; all were correctly diagnosed pre-operatively. Computed tomography (CT) scan with speciﬁc radiodensity recording was the preferred pre-operative investigation.\nConclusions: Lipomas should be considered in the differential diagnosis of soft-tissue head and neck masses even in rare locations.

In addition to increasing risk, obesity also confers worse prognosis for many cancers. Obesity represents an overall state of energy imbalance frequently associated with systemic effects including insulin resistance, altered hormone signaling, and high circulating levels of proinflammatory mediators. In addition to its systemic effects, obesity causes subclinical white adipose inflammation including increased tissue levels of proinflammatory mediators. Both local and systemic effects are likely to contribute to the development and progression of cancer. An understanding of the interplay between local and systemic alterations involved in the obesity–cancer link provides the basis for developing interventions aimed at mitigating the protumorigenic effects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Iyengar","given":"Neil M."},{"family":"Hudis","given":"Clifford A."},{"family":"Dannenberg","given":"Andrew J."}],"citation-key":"iyengarObesityCancerLocal2015","container-title":"Annual Review of Medicine","container-title-short":"Annu.

  {"id":"kuntzGastrointestinalCancerClassification2021","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal cancers account for approximately 20% of all cancer diagnoses and are responsible for 22.5% of cancer deaths worldwide. Artificial intelligence-based diagnostic support systems, in particular convolutional neural network (CNN)-based image analysis tools, have shown great potential in medical computer vision. In this systematic review, we summarise recent studies reporting CNN-based approaches for digital biomarkers for characterization and prognostication of gastrointestinal cancer pathology.\nMETHODS: Pubmed and Medline were screened for peer-reviewed papers dealing with CNN-based gastrointestinal cancer analyses from histological slides, published between 2015 and 2020.Seven hundred and ninety titles and abstracts were screened, and 58 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility.\nRESULTS: Sixteen publications fulfilled our inclusion criteria dealing with tumor or precursor lesion characterization or prognostic and predictive biomarkers: 14 studies on colorectal or rectal cancer, three studies on gastric cancer and none on esophageal cancer. These studies were categorised according to their end-points: polyp characterization, tumor characterization and patient outcome. Regarding the translation into clinical practice, we identified several studies demonstrating generalization of the classifier with external tests and comparisons with pathologists, but none presenting clinical implementation.\nCONCLUSIONS: Results of recent studies on CNN-based image analysis in gastrointestinal cancer pathology are promising, but studies were conducted in observational and retrospective settings. Large-scale trials are needed to assess performance and predict clinical usefulness. Furthermore, large-scale trials are required for approval of CNN-based prediction models as medical devices.","author":[{"family":"Kuntz","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Krieghoff-Henning","given":"Eva"},{"family":"Kather","given":"Jakob N."},{"family":"Jutzi","given":"Tanja"},{"family":"Höhn","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Kiehl","given":"Lennard"},{"family":"Hekler","given":"Achim"},{"family":"Alwers","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Kalle","given":"Christof","non-dropping-particle":"von"},{"family":"Fröhling","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Utikal","given":"Jochen S."},{"family":"Brenner","given":"Hermann"},{"family":"Hoffmeister","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Brinker","given":"Titus J."}],"citation-key":"kuntzGastrointestinalCancerClassification2021","container-title":"European Journal of Cancer (Oxford, England: 1990)","container-title-short":"Eur J Cancer","DOI":"10.1016/j.ejca.2021.07.012","ISSN":"1879-0852","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9]]},"language":"eng","page":"200-215","PMID":"34391053","source":"PubMed","title":"Gastrointestinal cancer classification and prognostication from histology using deep learning: Systematic review","title-short":"Gastrointestinal cancer classification and prognostication from histology using deep learning","type":"article-journal","volume":"155"},

  {"id":"mahinhashmiIntestinalSegmentResection2024","abstract":"Background: Intestinal segment resection is one of the major surgical procedures performed in elective and emergency settings. There are various etiological factors contributing to the intestinal pathologies wherein the patient might present with intestinal obstruction or peritonitis. However, there are very few published articles describing the type of intestinal resection and correlating it with etiological factors and post-operative HPE. Therefore, our study aims to include the above criteria and its relation with southern India and how it differs from other parts of India and the rest of the world. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of HPE reports of resected bowel segments which were collected from patient records who underwent intestinal resections. Data was subsequently analyzed, the factors beginning from the diagnosis to post-op recovery were evaluated. Results: Of the 97 patients included in the study 30 presented with AIO (Acute Intestinal Obstruction) followed by 23 with SAIO (Subacute Intestinal Obstruction) and 21 with peritonitis. During laparotomy, the most common finding was tumor followed by stricture and perforation. Ileum was the most common anatomical location of pathology as well as the cause of morbidity and mortality. Patients with ileostomy had the highest rate of mortality. Conclusion: The disease demographic is highly site and time-specific and surgeons should be ready to adapt and change their approach to management. In the setting of intestinal perforations, not all ileal perforations are due to typhoid and ileostomy doesn’t always save lives. The leading cause of non-adhesive intestinal obstruction is a tumor and a general surgeon should be in a position to do a right hemicolectomy or at least an ileocecal resection in the emergency setting followed by an anastomosis to expect a reasonably good outcome in the patient population presenting to the general surgery department.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Mahin Hashmi","given":""},{"family":"G.

Key images and associated labels from the studies were retrospectively extracted from the original study interpretation. These images were used for RadImageNet model training with random weight initiation. The RadImageNet models were compared with ImageNet models using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for eight classification tasks and using Dice scores for two segmentation problems.\n\nResults\n\nThe RadImageNet database consists of 1.35 million annotated medical images in 131 872 patients who underwent CT, MRI, and US for musculoskeletal, neurologic, oncologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, abdominal, and pulmonary pathologic conditions. For transfer learning tasks on small datasets—thyroid nodules (US), breast masses (US), anterior cruciate ligament injuries (MRI), and meniscal tears (MRI)—the RadImageNet models demonstrated a significant advantage (P < .001) to ImageNet models (9.4%, 4.0%, 4.8%, and 4.5% AUC improvements, respectively). For larger datasets—pneumonia (chest radiography), COVID-19 (CT), SARS-CoV-2 (CT), and intracranial hemorrhage (CT)—the RadImageNet models also illustrated improved AUC (P < .001) by 1.9%, 6.1%, 1.7%, and 0.9%, respectively.

  {"id":"merzlyakovPosthumanismVsTranshumanism2022","abstract":"Posthumanism and transhumanism are often identified. However, modern researchers indicate the fundamental difference between these intellectual schools. The fundamental idea of posthumanism is the rejection of biological, ethical, and ontological anthropocentrism. Transhumanism focuses on changing and improving natural human characteristics through biological, technological, and cognitive modifications. While posthumanism draws attention to the crisis of humanism, transhumanism is the latter’s heir. Scientific and ethical consequences of posthumanism, as well as the sociocultural potential of transhumanism, are considered in this article. Posthumanism carries risks of shifting the value focus from man to other objects, which in the long term can lead to a critical decrease in the value status of man. Transhumanism has the potential to preserve man as an effective economic and cognizing agent.

  {"id":"muka24stepGuideHow2020","abstract":"To inform evidence-based practice in health care, guidelines and policies require accurate identification, collation, and integration of all available evidence in a comprehensive, meaningful, and time-efficient manner. Approaches to evidence synthesis such as carefully conducted systematic reviews and meta-analyses are essential tools to summarize specific topics. Unfortunately, not all systematic reviews are truly systematic, and their quality can vary substantially. Since well-conducted evidence synthesis typically involves a complex set of steps, we believe formulating a cohesive, step-by-step guide on how to conduct a systemic review and meta-analysis is essential. While most of the guidelines on systematic reviews focus on how to report or appraise systematic reviews, they lack guidance on how to synthesize evidence efficiently. To facilitate the design and development of evidence syntheses, we provide a clear and concise, 24-step guide on how to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies and clinical trials. We describe each step, illustrate it with concrete examples, and provide relevant references for further guidance. The 24-step guide (1) simplifies the methodology of conducting a systematic review, (2) provides healthcare professionals and researchers with methodologically sound tools for conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and (3) it can enhance the quality of existing evidence synthesis efforts.

We report a 10-year experience in a single institution (La Timone University Hospital of Marseille, France). Among 614 parotidectomies for neoplasms performed from 1998 to 2008, 12 lipomas were identified. A retrospective analysis based on medical records was made. Evaluation, analysis and current management of lipomas of the parotid gland are described. Lipomas accounted for 2% of all parotid neoplasms and 2.6% of benign tumors in our series. The median age of patients was 60 years with a M/F sex ratio of 5–1. The main presentation was a soft asymptomatic, slow-growing, mobile mass although 30% had an indurated mass on palpation. Diagnosis of lipoma, based on the results of imaging, was made preoperatively in all cases. The mean tumor duration prior to excision was 11.5 months. The surgical decision was made regarding increased swelling with functional/esthetic discomfort in 83% of cases. Partial parotidectomy was performed in most cases. Postoperative complications occurred in 16% of cases although no permanent complication was observed. No recurrence was observed in our series. Histologically, 92% of tumors were classic lipomas. Lipomas can be clinically misleading since 30% of patients in our series showed an indurated mass on palpation. Preoperative imaging, especially MRI, is the cornerstone of their management as it allows very accurate lipoma diagnosis. Since in our series, diagnosis of lipoma had been made preoperatively in all cases, the surgical excision could be delayed and finally surgical decision has been made for esthetic and/or functional considerations in more than 80% of cases.","author":[{"literal":"Nicolas Fakhry"},{"family":"Fakhry","given":"Nicolas"},{"literal":"J.

In addition, lipomas involving the deep parotid lobe are extremely unusual. That is why lipomas are not often considered for differential diagnosis of parotid lumps. Concerning diagnostic tools, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is nowadays considered as the main imaging examination for parotid lipomas due to a characteristic signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted images. Furthermore, even if the cost of MRI is nearly three times that of computed tomography, MRI is accurate, safe, and has few biological costs for the patient. In this reported case, MRI provided all information for either diagnosis or preoperative planning being the best diagnostic tool regarding tumor margin characteristics and surrounding tissues’ involvement. Concerning treatment, surgical excision of parotid masses is always mandatory for definitive diagnosis, but it is challenging because of the facial nerve. For this reason, a well-established surgical technique is mandatory for success. The authors present a rare case of parotid gland lipoma arising from the deep lobe and discuss diagnostic tools and surgical technique.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Paparo","given":"Francesco"},{"family":"Massarelli","given":"Mauro"},{"family":"Giuliani","given":"Giorgio"}],"citation-key":"paparoRareCaseParotid2016","container-title":"Annals of Maxillofacial Surgery","container-title-short":"Ann Maxillofac Surg","DOI":"10.4103/2231-0746.200335","ISSN":"2231-0746","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"308-310","PMCID":"PMC5343648","PMID":"28299278","source":"PubMed Central","title":"A rare case of parotid gland lipoma arising from the deep lobe of the parotid gland","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5343648/","volume":"6"},

Microscopists commonly examine thick and thin blood smears to diagnose disease and compute parasitemia. However, their accuracy depends on smear quality and expertise in classifying and counting parasitized and uninfected cells. Such an examination could be arduous for large-scale diagnoses resulting in poor quality. State-of-the-art image-analysis based computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) methods using machine learning (ML) techniques, applied to microscopic images of the smears using hand-engineered features demand expertise in analyzing morphological, textural, and positional variations of the region of interest (ROI). In contrast, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a class of deep learning (DL) models promise highly scalable and superior results with end-to-end feature extraction and classification. Automated malaria screening using DL techniques could, therefore, serve as an effective diagnostic aid. In this study, we evaluate the performance of pre-trained CNN based DL models as feature extractors toward classifying parasitized and uninfected cells to aid in improved disease screening. We experimentally determine the optimal model layers for feature extraction from the underlying data. Statistical validation of the results demonstrates the use of pre-trained CNNs as a promising tool for feature extraction for this purpose.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Rajaraman","given":"Sivaramakrishnan"},{"family":"Antani","given":"Sameer K."},{"family":"Poostchi","given":"Mahdieh"},{"family":"Silamut","given":"Kamolrat"},{"family":"Hossain","given":"Md.

  {"id":"salehBrownRiceWhite2019","abstract":"Obesity and chronic diet-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, cancers, and celiac are increasing worldwide. The increasing prevalence of these diseases has led nutritionists and food scientists to pay more attention to the relationship between diet and different disease risks. Among different foods, rice has received increasing attention because it is a major component of billions of peoples' diets throughout the world. Rice is commonly consumed after polishing or whitening and the polished grain is known a high glycemic food because of its high starch content. In addition, the removal of the outer bran layer during rice milling results in a loss of nutrients, dietary fiber, and bioactive components. Therefore, many studies were performed to investigate the potential health benefits for the consumption of whole brown rice (BR) grain in comparison to the milled or white rice (WR). The objective of this work was to review the recent advances in research performed for purposes of evaluation of nutritional value and potential health benefits of the whole BR grain. Studies carried out for purposes of developing BR-based food products are reviewed. BR safety and preservation treatments are also explored. In addition, economic and environmental benefits for the consumption of whole BR instead of the polished or WR are presented. Furthermore, challenges facing the commercialization of BR and future perspectives to promote its utilization as food are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Saleh","given":"Ahmed S.

It thus requires a careful and precise examination to establish a diagnosis. A surgical procedure of the parotid gland is challenging due to the associated risk factor of facial nerve injury. We report a rare case of head and neck region lipoma between the superficial and deep lobe of the parotid gland. A 44-year-old female patient was presented with the chief complaint of a painless lump on the left front ear to the left cheek for about 1 year. There were no complaints of tooth pain before the lump appeared, and there were no lumps in other regions. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging were all performed to establish the preoperative diagnosis and to plan the correct surgical approach. Lipoma was the initial clinical diagnosis, and a surgical excision with superficial parotidectomy and facialis nerve preservation was performed. Follow-up examinations were conducted to assess any facial nerve injury complications. Conclusion Lipoma rarely grows in the parotid gland. Careful diagnosis should be performed to establish a precise surgery for parotid dissection and facial nerve preservation.","author":[{"family":"Santoso","given":"Sergio"},{"literal":"Andra Rizqiawan"},{"literal":"Indra Mulyawan"},{"literal":"Asdi Wihandono"},{"literal":"Muhammad Subhan Amir"}],"citation-key":"santosoLipomaParotidGland2023","DOI":"10.1055/s-0042-1758795","issue":"03","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,4]]},"note":"MAG ID: 4313490113","page":"929-934","PMID":"36599447","title":"Lipoma in Parotid Gland: A Rare Case Report","type":"article-journal","volume":"17"},
