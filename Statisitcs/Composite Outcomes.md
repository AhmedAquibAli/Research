creating one measure that combines multiple outcomes is a lot like using a

composite outcome in a clinical trial. In a randomized trial composite outcomes can make a trial more efficient and are sometimes used when events of **Interest are rare**

Composite outcome combines multiple outcomes.
- Should be clinically meaningful
- Should reflect intervention target 
- To be reported as single primary outcome (eg: MACE-Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events) individual outcomes will be reported as secondary outcomes

# PROS:
- Helps when the individual outcomes are rare
- Requires smaller sample size and less time required
- Cost Effective

# CONS:
- Equal wieghtage might misrepresent individual outcomes
- Some outcomes might be significant for composite outcome but might not be targeted by the intervention leading to Type 2 errora
