> because of cosmetic discomfort. Moreover, she complained about the slow growing of the lump over the years. Clinical examination showed a soft, nontender, mobile mass which is deep into the superficial skin surface lump measuring 6 cm × 4 cm in size. The swelling was located over the region of the left parotid gland. The overlying skin was normal without any sign of adhesion. The examination of either the neck or the facial nerve function was unremarkable [Figure 1]. The MRI of the parotid region showed a well‐defined mass with adipose tissue signal arising from the left deep lobe of the parotid gland extending through the superficial tissues [Figure 2]. Fine‐needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was not performed due to the enough amount of information provided by MRI. Thus, a parotidectomy was planned. A classic parotidectomy incision was performed and through blunt dissection, the main trunk of the facial nerve was identified at the stylomastoid foramen. From the facial nerve, its main trunks were separated from the overlying superficial  parotid lobe until a yellowish fatty well‐encapsulated mass was identified at the deep lobe [Figure 3]. The tumor was then totally enucleated after mobilization of the overlying facial nerve branches. The histopathological examination confirmed the presence of a lipoma. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and the facial nerve function was normal at discharge. Neither recurrence nor Frey’s syndrome was observed 2 years after the surgery [Figure 4].  DISCUSSION  Lipomas are the most common benign mesenchymal encapsulated tumors histologically similar to mature adipose tissue. Only an average of 25% of lipomas and their variants are observed in the head and neck region.[6] More rarely, they can arise from the parotid gland. The reported incidence varies from 0.6% to 4.4% among parotid tumors. Concerning the age of onset, they arise most frequently in the fifth and sixth decades of life with male predominance.[7] Lipomas of the deep parotid lobe are even more infrequent. They use to grow slowly, usually without symptoms. In most cases, like ours, patients claim surgery for cosmetic con
