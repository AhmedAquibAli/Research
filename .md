> [!NOTE]- Abstract
> Lipomas are the most commonly encountered benign mesenchymal tumors, but their occurrence in the head and neck is rare, even more at the level of the parotid region where they can be found nearby the parotid capsule, inside the capsule, or within the gland. In addition, lipomas involving the deep parotid lobe are extremely unusual. That is why lipomas are not often considered for differential diagnosis of parotid lumps. Concerning diagnostic tools, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is nowadays considered as the main imaging examination for parotid lipomas due to a characteristic signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted images. Furthermore, even if the cost of MRI is nearly three times that of computed tomography, MRI is accurate, safe, and has few biological costs for the patient. In this reported case, MRI provided all information for either diagnosis or preoperative planning being the best diagnostic tool regarding tumor margin characteristics and surrounding tissues’ involvement. Concerning treatment, surgical excision of parotid masses is always mandatory for definitive diagnosis, but it is challenging because of the facial nerve. For this reason, a well-established surgical technique is mandatory for success. The authors present a rare case of parotid gland lipoma arising from the deep lobe and discuss diagnostic tools and surgical technique.

Clinical examination showed a soft, nontender, mobile mass which is deep into the superficial skin surface lump measuring 6 cm × 4 cm in size. The swelling was located over the region of the left parotid gland. The overlying skin was normal without any sign of adhesion. The examination of either the neck or the facial nerve function was unremarkable [Figure 1]. The MRI of the parotid region showed a well‐defined mass with adipose tissue signal arising from the left deep lobe of the parotid gland extending through the superficial tissues [Figure 2]. Fine‐needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was not performed due to the enough amount of information provided by MRI. Thus, a parotidectomy was planned. A classic parotidectomy incision was performed and through blunt dissection, the main trunk of the facial nerve was identified at the stylomastoid foramen. From the facial nerve, its main trunks were separated from the overlying superficial  parotid lobe until a yellowish fatty well‐encapsulated mass was identified at the deep lobe [Figure 3]. The tumor was then totally enucleated after mobilization of the overlying facial nerve branches. The histopathological examination confirmed the presence of a lipoma. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and the facial nerve function was normal at discharge. Neither recurrence nor Frey’s syndrome was observed 2 years after the surgery [Figure 4].  DISCUSSION  Lipomas are the most common benign mesenchymal encapsulated tumors histologically similar to mature adipose tissue. Only an average of 25% of lipomas and their variants are observed in the head and neck region.[6] More rarely, they can arise from the parotid gland. The reported incidence varies from 0.6% to 4.4% among parotid tumors. Concerning the age of onset, they arise most frequently in the fifth and sixth decades of life with male predominance.[7] Lipomas of the deep parotid lobe are even more infrequent. They use to grow slowly, usually without symptoms. In most cases, like ours, patients claim surgery for cosmetic con” Purple Highlight [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5132257/items/2FPXZYFM?page=309&annotation=UCQUJFCW)
