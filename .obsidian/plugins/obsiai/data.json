Approximately 80% of salivary gland tumors occur in the parotid gland 2. Majority of parotid gland tumors are benign, with pleomorphic adenoma being the most common 3. Lipoma of the parotid gland is rare, with an average incidence of 4.4% among all parotid malignancies, and a male-to-female ratio of 5:1 4. Lipomas represent the most common mesenchymal tumors of the body, of which majority affect the trunk and upper extremities however, they are uncommon in the head and neck regions. The diagnosis of an intraparotid lipoma can be challenging and often confused with mixed parotid tumors 5. Therefore, a more accurate diagnosis is necessary, which is enabled by improved preoperative evaluation tools such as MRI and FNAC. This case report outlines the diagnosis and surgical approach for a rare parotid region lipoma.",

The swelling started gradually and has increased in size. He did not report any tooth pain, and no lumps were found in other areas. There is no relevant medical history or family history of tumors in the head and neck regions.\n\nOn local examination, a solitary swelling of about 4 x 3 cm was found in the right pre-auricular region, causing the ear lobule to lift upwards (Fig 1) . The swelling felt firm and was not compressible. The skin over the swelling looked normal, and no other masses in the head and neck area were detected. The examination of the facial nerve showed no abnormalities.\n\nUltrasound, Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), and CT scan were performed sequentially to establish a pre-operative diagnosis and to plan the best surgical approach. Ultrasound revealed a well-defined iso-hyperechoic lesion measuring 43 x 36 x 23 mm in the parotid region with no internal vascularity. FNAC results showed clusters of mature adipocytes mixed with fibroblasts on a mixed hemorrhagic background. CT scan of the head and neck revealed a well-defined 48 x 38 mm lesion with Hounsfield units (HU) of -100 in the right parotid gland involving the superficial and deep lobes, suggesting an intraparotid lipoma (Fig 2). Since ultrasound was unable to distinguish between the superficial and deep lobe, a CT/MRI should be performed to determine the precise location.\n\nWe performed tumor excision via a superficial parotidectomy with facial nerve preservation under general anaesthesia using a modified Blair incision (Fig 3). without causing any significant damage to neurovascular structures.  Intraoperatively a large capsulated soft mass measuring  6 x 5.5 x 2 cm was removed and sent for Histopathological examination, which revealed focal parotid parenchyma with lobules of mature adipocytes separated by fibrous septa, confirming the diagnosis of intraparotid lipoma.\n\nPostoperatively, facial nerve function remained intact (Fig 4). The patient was discharged after 3 days with a smooth recovery. He has been followed up for 12 months with no recurrence of the disease.",
